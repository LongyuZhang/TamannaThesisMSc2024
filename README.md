**AI-Assisted Interactive Assistants for Software Issue Report Understanding**

ssue reports in software projects often become complex due to their technical details and lengthy discussions. This
complexity can hinder quick understanding of these reports, impacting the development process adversely. This thesis
investigates how AI can simplify exploring and navigating these reports. It first introduces iSum, an issue summarizer
tool designed to generate visual summaries of information types present in issue reports and analyze the prevalence
and trends of these across a report or repository. Next, it addresses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based
ChatGPTâ€™s struggle in understanding complex technical content and interpreting context from queries for exploring
OSS bug reports; where our enhancement, the ChatGPT Inaccuracy Mitigation Engine (CHIME), boosts response
correctness by around 30%. Both iSum and CHIME demonstrate the potential of AI to enhance the comprehensibility
of issue reports, taking a step forward in efficient software development.
